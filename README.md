# LeetCode-ts Solution

LeetCode solutions based on TypeScript // 基于ts的LeetCode题解

## Description

As a BE programmer before, FE programming language (JavaScript/TypeScript) is not my first programming language. Nowadays, TS has been first choice to build a FE system but there are less solutions about TypeScript in Leetcode. So it is the first time that I start to program TS codes systematically and improve the solutions based on the experience of LeetCode-py before as much as possible.  // LeetCode上的TS方案较少，然而目前TS已经逐渐代替了JS作为前端开发的语言（虽然TS是JS的超集），这次将基于先前py刷题经验，找出更合适的LeetCode-TS解题方案。

## Goal

- Familiar with TypeScript
- Record the path of LeetCode-ts
- Design elegant solutions

## Getting Started

### Installing

In order to run and debug easily, we need to configure vscode or webstorm and download the useful package, such as ts-node, typescript.

```bash
npm i typescript -g
npm i ts-node -g
```

Because of my preference, I am absorbed into the intelligence of webstorm and then I download a plugin named **Run Configuration for TypeScript** in webstorm so as to run and debug in IDE straightly. // Webstorm是第一生产力，推荐大家用它作为项目开发首选IDE，它有很多magic tricks和efficient tips，个人觉得在写大型项目方面比vscode更好用一些。安装了插件 **Run Configuration for TypeScript** 和 ts-node就能一键运行TS代码并调试。
